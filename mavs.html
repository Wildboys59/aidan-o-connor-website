            <h2>Minnesota State Mavericks Hockey</h2>
            <p>The Minnesota State Mavericks Hockey Program was founded in 1969.</p>
            <p>The Minnesota State Mavericks men's hockey team, representing Minnesota State University, Mankato, has a rich history in collegiate ice hockey. The program has grown significantly, becoming a prominent force in NCAA Division I hockey. Initially a club team, the Mavericks transitioned to varsity status in the 1990s. They became part of the NCAA Division II and later moved to Division I in 2013, joining the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The Mavericks have consistently performed well in their conference and have made numerous appearances in the NCAA tournament. Under the guidance of various successful coaches, the program has developed a reputation for producing talented players and competing at a high level. Their success culminated in multiple WCHA titles and NCAA tournament runs, including a notable trip to the Frozen Four in 2021. The Mavericks have built a passionate fan base and are known for their strong on-ice performance and commitment to player development.</p>
